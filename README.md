REFLECTION:

This industry talk made me realize how important it is to have a wide variety of skills in order to stay afloat in the field of computer science. It is a field that is constantly evolving and moving forward, so we have to learn to keep up and make advancements in terms of our own base knowledge and skills so that we don’t fall behind. I hope to expand my skillset and maintain my discipline in the upcoming years so that I am able to face any challenge the industry throws my way.
